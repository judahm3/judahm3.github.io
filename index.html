      <h2>About the Microbit v1</h2>
        <p>
The micro:bit is a small digital device which you can use to control physical computing projects. Unlike the Crumble microcontroller, you can also use a micro:bit on its own, because it has some built-in inputs and outputs. Like a Crumble, you need to program the micro:bit from another device. You can write simple games, create electronic projects and work your way up to small but complex programs. I've used a Mac, PC and an iPad to program the Micro:bit all very easy to do if you follow the instructions. It's fun and has bags of potential for not a lot of money. Loads of support and example programs online.

      <h2>Judah's Review:</h2>
      <p>I agree that the Microbit is an interlocking device that entertains people into coding and programming microcomputers. The v1 has a bunch of small (but very powerful) microchips. It also has a bunch of sensors, such as a light sensor, magenotemeter sensor. I rate it a 7/10.</p>

      <h2>About the Microbit v2</h2>
      <p>The micro:bit v2 introduces a microphone, speaker, and capacitive touch input on the boardâ€™s logo. The new blocks designed for the micro:bit v2 will not work with the micro:bit v1.</p>

      <h2>Judah's Review:</h2>
      <p>The microbit v2 is also a new microcomputer that also unlocks endless possibilities. It has a new sensitive touch sensor and a microphone. The reset button is now an on and off switch: if you hold the reset button for 3 seconds, it will turn off. Once it's off and you want to turn it back on, press the reset button to turn it on. I also rate it 10/10.</p>
